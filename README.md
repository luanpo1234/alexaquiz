# alexaquiz
Sample Alexa quiz on lambda, questions in German.

Coded on Python 3.6. No use of Flask.

## Prerequisites

An AWS Lambda account. Both files were added to Lambda.
Since, in this model, the answers are given in full (and not as "Option B", etc.), there was considerable work to adjust the
slots and test utterances in the Alexa Skill Kit.
